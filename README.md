# heat-dissipation-simulation

A simulation for heat dissipation on a metal surface.

The simulation requires the user to input the following initial conditions:

1- Initial temperature from all 4 sides

2- Threshold to stop the simulation

3- Number of rows/columns on the simulation grid

The simulation will then output a color-mapped temperature simulation and a contour map simulation.
